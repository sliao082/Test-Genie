## Potential Risks and Challenges

### Frontend-Backend Integration
- Debugging issues in API communication might delay progress. Regular integration tests are planned.

### AI Model Fine-Tuning
- Poorly fine-tuned models may generate irrelevant or incorrect content. We plan to rigorously test the model and refine it using specific datasets.

### Ethical Concerns
- AI-generated content could inadvertently contain biases. Please be careful to the results generated.
