Q:For CS222 projects, a project manager
S:Is a responsibility best managed by one individual but not as their only role
S:Is a necessary set of responsibilities that can be shared or rotated throughout the course of a project
S:Is a set of responsibilities that is necessary and must be shared throughout the project
S:Is a role that should be taken on by a team member as their sole responsibility
A:Is a necessary set of responsibilities that can be shared or rotated throughout the course of a project
Q:What is the main difference between the "guessing" and "analyzing" approaches to estimating task durations?
S:Guessing is recommended for all types of tasks, whereas analyzing is only suitable for complex tasks.
S:Analyzing is considered a quick method, while guessing requires detailed planning.
S:Guessing involves using past experience and intuition while analyzing relies on breaking down the task into parts and using systematic methods.
S:There is no significant difference; both methods are equally effective and interchangeable.
A:Guessing involves using past experience and intuition while analyzing relies on breaking down the task into parts and using systematic methods.
Q:Scrum
S:Is the best Agile method currently known
S:Is a universal principle applied to project management
S:Involves iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to change.
S:Is the required method for CS222 teams to use
A:Involves iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to change.
Q:Quality assurance and testing - which of the following is NOT a responsibility of a QA Role?
S:Tests code
S:Ensures software meets quality standards
S:Designs and executes test plans
S:Identifies and reports bugs
A:Tests code
Q:For a CS222 project, the business analyst
S:Writes the core "business logic" for primary functionality
S:Is a set of responsibilities best shared by the entire team
S:Determines appropriate algorithms for specific functionality
S:Is a role that is not needed
A:Determines appropriate algorithms for specific functionality
QManaging smaller projects has risks of
S:Redundancy or overlap
S:Poor communication
S:No one accepting responsibility
S:All of the above
A:All of the above
Q;Would you like a thorough orientation of Scrum later in the semester?
S:No
S:Yes
A:Yes
Q:Which are the 2 approaches mentioned in the lecture for "estimating your task"?
S:Timeboxing vs guessing
S:Benchmark vs timebox
S:Analyzing vs planning poker
S:Guessing vs analyzing
A:Both Guessing vs analyzing and Benchmark vs timebox are correct.
Q:PERT is
S:A calculation that weights optimistic, pessimistic, and most-likely estimates to arrive at a hedged estimate
S:A reliable way to calculate the most likely duration to complete a task
S:Inferior to Planning Poker
S:The industry standard in calculating completion time for tasks
A:A calculation that weights optimistic, pessimistic, and most-likely estimates to arrive at a hedged estimate
Q:Halstead Volume is
S:An accurate measure of difficulty of a complex system used to estimate overall completion time for a complex system
S:A metric used to put a measure on a system by counting and weighting various programming language constructs
S:Mentioned in this lecture for comparison to using some form of metric to estimate task completion time
S:Not mentioned in this lecture
A:A metric used to put a measure on a system by counting and weighting various programming language constructs
